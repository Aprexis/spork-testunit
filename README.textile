h1. Test::Unit support for Spork with ruby 1.9.2 and Rails 3.2.x support

This includes a plugin for spork to enable Test::Unit support for spork. It also comes with a very bare-bones drb client to run tests.

Then, once spork is running, invoke @testdrb@ (e.g. @testdrb paht/to/test/test.rb@) to run your tests under Spork.
